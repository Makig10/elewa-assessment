This project is responsible for making the social impact,about and invest pages as shown in the links:https://elewa.ke/social-impact,https://elewa.ke/about,https://elewa.ke/invest.
Each page is housed in a component ending with "main-page"
I have designed my project such that each feature such as the home page is singular component and each sub-feature is also a cub-component.
I have used normal css for each component.
The components are named according to its corresponding feature.
